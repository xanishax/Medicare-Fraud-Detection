Data exploration and Feature Selection: Explain data exploration and feature selection processes performed.

Building Classification Models using R: Apply the classification algorithms to build at least four classifiers to detect fraudulent interactions - decision tree, neural networks, SVM, random forests, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors or Ensemble methods.
  
For each method, briefly report settings used to run the algorithm (that is, parameter optimization) and the performance measures that you select (e.g., accuracy, misclassification error rate, precision, recall). As you choose your optimal model for each method, you might end up having several options for a given method. Here, you should report only one model per given method. That is, if you decide to use SVM, decision tree, KNN and neural network, you should report four models – one per each method. 

Model Comparison and Conclusion: In this part, the focus should be on describing performance indicators and selecting the best performing model. For the model that yields the best performance, you should provide feature importance analysis and discuss the variables that are most predictive of the fraudulent activities.
